# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning-Project-1

Unsupervised Machine Learning

This dataset was colllected from kaggle and is collection of customer's records from a supermarket records of 2 years. It has consists of 2240 records (rows) and 29 features(columns).
Our objective is to segregrate the data into groups such that they reflect similarities of the customers in each group. This will be useful for business purposes as we can cater to different needs and requirements of our customers, and modify our products to suit our customer needs. We can also direct customer specfic promotional deals and camapaigns that can help in boosting our sales and popularity of our products.
Here we will be performing an 'Unsupervised Classifcation' on the dataset. We will try to segreagrate the dataset into clusters first and then try to evaluate the same

The is an intermediate level data analysis-

Unsupervised Classification - Customer Segmentation.ipynb file consists of the data analysis procedure giving detailed intructions showing step by step on how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) - "Plotting(Boxenplots, Histograms)", "Feature Selection and Exploration - Creating New Features", "One-Hot Encoding" etc.

After finishing EDA we will first be performing Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and then try 2  clustering techniques - K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC). For k-means we will be using 2 metrics - Distortion and Silhouette Score (Calcualting and plotting them) and for HAC we will be using Ward Linkage. 

Finally, our last step would be evaluating and profiling our clusters with respect to the data/information that we have. Various plotting methods will be used to assist and help us with casual inference to understand our customer data in a better way so that we can target the customers and approach them in a more efficient manner.
